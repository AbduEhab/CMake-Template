# Cmake-Template Repo

For those who are like me and just wanna yoink some ready-to-go clean project files.

## Requirements (for compiling)
- [CMake](https://cmake.org/)
- x86 or x64 compiler (only tested with `MSVC`, `MinGW` on windows and `GCC` for UNIX)

## Profiling

You can use https://ui.perfetto.dev/ to view the profiling data. The data is stored in `profiling/` and is named `perfetto_trace.json`.
